# Base App

Welcome to my Base App! This project is built using Expo, a framework for building React Native applications.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>= 12.x)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/noahschwagele/base-app.git
```

### Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd base-app
```

### Install Dependencies

Using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Or using Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Running the App

Now that you have cloned the repository and installed the dependencies, you can run the app using Expo.

### Start the Expo Development Server

```bash
expo start
```

This will open the Expo Developer Tools in your default web browser. You can then choose to run the app on an emulator or scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your mobile device.

For more details on running Expo projects, refer to the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/).

## Customize and Build

Feel free to customize the app according to your needs. You can edit the source files in the `src` directory and make any necessary changes.
